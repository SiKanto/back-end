# Backend System with Node.js, Hapi, TensorFlow, and Machine Learning Model Integration

This repository contains the backend system for our application, built using **Node.js**, **Hapi.js Framework**, and **TensorFlow**. It is designed to integrate and serve machine learning models, specifically utilizing TensorFlow for making predictions.

## Overview

The backend system handles API requests, integrates machine learning models (trained with TensorFlow), and serves predictions. It also performs necessary data preprocessing, and supports testing with tools like **Postman**.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime for building scalable and fast server-side applications.
- **Hapi.js**: A rich framework for building applications and services in Node.js.
- **TensorFlow**: A machine learning library used for training and serving ML models in the backend.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing API requests and ensuring that our backend endpoints work as expected.

## System Architecture

The backend follows a modular architecture:
1. **API Layer**: Built with Hapi.js to define routes and handle requests from the client.
2. **ML Model Integration**: TensorFlow is used to load and interact with the pre-trained machine learning models. The backend processes incoming requests, runs the necessary data transformations, and uses the model for predictions.
3. **Data Handling**: Preprocessing data from the client-side to the format expected by the model. This layer also handles model results and structures them into responses.
4. **Testing**: APIs are tested using **Postman** to ensure they behave as expected and perform error handling and data validation correctly.

## Development Workflow

The development process consists of the following key steps:

### 1. **Planning the Idea**
   The project begins with a clear understanding of the business problem and how machine learning can help address it. We define what kind of model is required (classification, regression, etc.) and how it integrates into the backend.

### 2. **Coding the Backend**
   - Set up a **Node.js** environment with the necessary dependencies.
   - Implement **Hapi.js** routes to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Integrate **TensorFlow** to load and interact with the pre-trained machine learning models.

### 3. **Integrating the ML Model**
   - Load the pre-trained model using **TensorFlow**.
   - Preprocess the data (cleaning, transforming) before passing it to the model.
   - Use the model to make predictions and return the results to the client.

### 4. **Testing with Postman**
   - Create requests in **Postman** for each API endpoint to verify correct functionality.
   - Ensure that responses from the backend contain expected data and error handling works properly.

## Installation

To get started with the backend project, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SiKanto/back-end.git
   cd back-end
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (if applicable). You may need a `.env` file for secret keys or configuration.

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server locally.

## Testing with Postman

You can use **Postman** to test your backend API endpoints.

1. **Open Postman** and create a new request.
2. Set the request method (GET, POST, etc.) and URL.
3. If necessary, include headers (such as authorization tokens).
4. In the body, include the data to be sent to the API.
5. Send the request and check the response.

**Example**:  
To test an API endpoint for predicting a result using the ML model:
- URL: `/api/predict`
- Method: `POST`
- Body:
```json
{
  "data": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]
}
```

## Usage

Once the backend is running, you can use the API endpoints to interact with the machine learning model.

For example:
- **GET** `/api/predict`: Makes a prediction based on provided data.

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]}'
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "prediction": 0.89
}
```
